[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2016f/cw-01-northeast_corner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2016f/cw-01-northeast_corner)

**Due date:** 2016/09/06

## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. For Python files that include test functions, GitHub will automatically run your tests with ```nosetests``` on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework in the build status image above.

1. In SageCloud, create a LaTeX file ```testlatex.tex``` (using the template in the ```info``` repository). In this file write an explanation of what the definition of the derivative $f'(x)$ of a function $f(x)$ means.  Include both inline and numbered equations, as well as a proper title, abstract, and section headings. Find a suitable image to illustrate your definition online, and include it as a figure, with proper citation of the source. After ensuring that your LaTeX file compiles properly to pdf, commit only the source file ```testlatex.tex``` to GitHub in this repository.
1. In SageCloud, create a python file ```testpython.py```. In this file write only a single function ```test_trivial()``` that contains only the line ```assert True```. Commit this python file to GitHub in this repository and ensure that the Travis tests detect it and report a passing status. You will need to edit the links in this README file and commit the changes to GitHub to see the Travis status image.
1. In SageCloud, create a Sage Math Worksheet ```testsage.sagews```. Explore the menus to see what it can do, and demonstrate a few neat examples that you like. Give the document a properly formatted header and sections, as well as some text describing what you chose and why. Commit the file to GitHub in this repo
## Assessment

Analyze in this section what you found useful about this assignment in your own words. Include any lingering questions or comments that you may have.

**CHANGEME**

_INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS:_
_Looks like you didn't finish the classwork! The python test part was done correctly. Note that the formatting of Markdown is very picky: the \#\#Assessment above is not rendering as a subsection because there is not a blank line before it._

_Be sure to keep up with classwork/homeworks! If you get behind in this course, it will be very difficult to catch up, because all the material is cumulative. If you are having trouble, please seek office hours, speak to classmates who can help, and spend the needed time reading and working through coding examples on your own. There are many resources in the info repository, and Google is your friend._

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
